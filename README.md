# Image Stitching
This folder contains implementation of image stitching in python using OpenCV. You will find two subfolders:
* high_level_api_stitching: This implementation uses High-level API provided by OpenCV Stitcher class. In this implementation you dont get much of control on stitching process but it very simple to use. 
* stepwise_stitching: After using Opencv Stitcher class, I just got curious about stitching process and in order to understand the process better I ended up implementing basic stitching pipeline in this sub-folder. Provided implementation wont be useful to get result as good as OpenCV Sitcher class but I believe it will help you develop a basic understanding of stitching process.
